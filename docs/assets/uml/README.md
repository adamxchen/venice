# PlantUML
[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/starting) is an open-sourced tool that allows you to write diagrams such as sequence,
object, component, usecase, class diagrams and more. You can install the PlantUML locally or add the plugin in your IDE
to preview the diagrams, or even just use the [online editor](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) generate the diagrams.

For contributing plantuml diagrams to the Venice project, it's recommended to generate diagrams into svg format by following
this [guide](https://plantuml.com/svg). The svg format is more suitable for web pages.
