### Introduction
This folder contains codes to generate diagrams of the project. As Venice is a complicated system, it is useful to have 
diagrams to help understand the architecture and the flow of data. 

Note that we prefer to keep the diagrams as code and only maintain codes in the repository, not the generated diagram, 
so that the diagrams changes are minimal and can be tracked by git. More importantly, these diagrams can be shared and 
modified by the community easily.

#### UML
[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/starting) is an open-sourced tool that allows you to write diagrams such as sequence, 
object, component, usecase, class diagrams and more. You can install the PlantUML locally or add the plugin in your IDE 
to preview the diagrams, or even just use the online editor to generate the diagrams.
